Pseudocode to help with common awkward situations

If you have any tips on how to handle awkward interractions, please submit a pull request. Try to keep with the current pseudocode style as follows:

```
function function_name_in_snake_case:
    VARIABLE = 4
    Question in sentince case ending in question mark?
        Possible answer 1:
            blahblahblah
        Possible answer 2:
            Question nested however deep you want?
                Possible answer a:
    Another question?
        Yes:
            return 9
        No:
            return VARIABLE
        Maybe:
            return False
```

Also try to keep advice PG13.  This is the internet, mind you!
